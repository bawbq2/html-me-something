       <h1>Thanksgiving 2019</h1>
       <p id="intro">I had been a mess (confession: I still am. But I was worse then, trust me). I was in a job that was making me more and more miserable by the day. Don't get me wrong, I don't blame the job. The problems were all inside my head, just exacerbated by a career choice that did not fit my personality and brain chemistry. Earlier in the year I had vowed to take a trip to California and visit my family and friends there. But the year was coming closer to an end and I hadn't planned it. I didn't have time. Work was too important. The work that I did not enjoy and that was damaging my mental and physical health. Less than a week before Thanksgiving, my brain started working for just a few minutes. I called my aunt in San Diego and asked if I could drop by unannounced. She and her brother (my uncle) were planning to visit their sister (my other aunt) and another family friend in the Palm Springs area for Thanksgiving and they would be thrilled to have me. I was reminded that my family loved me and did not see my as a burden. I booked my flight. I texted my friend who had moved to LA a few years earlier and had asked me several times to come visit. Even though she was the mother of two small children living a chaotic life she was thrilled to host me for my first day and half in the The Golden State.<p>

<h2>Yesterday</h2>
<h3 class="date">Monday (11/25/2019)</h3>
<p>I was up at 4 AM to catch my 6 AM flight to 
  Los Angeles. By the way, one benefit of the job that I was struggling 
  with was the massive number of Southwest points it had given me. The 
  flights didn't cost me a dime. And, Southwest is the Best... when you 
  have A List Status. A legend for those who might not "wanna get away" 
  as often. Here is where you can sit on the plane broken down by your 
  boarding group:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>Anywhere</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>Back</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>Center</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Fortunately, I could sit anywhere. There are so many movie options 
  in Southwest's in-flight entertainment app. I started the trip by 
  watching a movie I'd been wanting to watch for months but just couldn't 
  find the time, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday_(2019_film)">Yesterday.</a> I enjoyed watching it, and was happy I did, but it was not what I'd call a good movie. It took advantage of my lifelong love, obsession, and emotional connection to The Beatles. So yes, I shed a few a tears... but no, I wouldn't give it two thumbs up. So I sat back, relaxed, and let it be. I was off to a good start!</p>

<h2>Tea Party</h2>
<h3 class="date" id="samedate">Still Monday (11/25/2019)</h3>
<p>I had called my uncle two days before to ask what I should see during my 36 hours in LA. <a href = "https://www.huntington.org/">Huntington Gardens</a> was first on his list. I let my friend know, and it turns out she had been there with her husband and had been wanting to go back and have tea at the teahouse on the property. She was able to get us a reservation! I don't know if I'd ever done something so fancy. The sandwiches, scones, sweets, and savories were all exquisite. We also had two tea party guests under the age of two, so don't mind the sippy cup, stroller, and crayons! Even though afternoon tea made us feel like we were in England, the bill was fortunately in $ and not &pound.</p>

<h2>Walk of Fame</h2>
<h3 class="date" id="samedate">Still Monday (11/25/2019)</h3>
<p>It had been a long day already, but I really wanted to do something touristy. We drove from Pasadena towards Hollywood Boulevard. On the way, we passed a big box store that looked familiar... it was Cloud Nine, the store from Superstore. This was cool because:</p> <ol><li>I like Superstore</li><li>Superstore is set in St. Louis. Worlds Collide!</li></ol><p>Hollywood Boulevard was packed and crazy and I felt silly for wanting to see the stars. We drove past the busiest part and parked on the street in a random place where it was less busy. I jumped out assuming I wouldn't see any stars of interest. I was dead wrong. I'll let the picture tell the story, in case you are into that whole brevity thing.</p>

<h2>The Getty</h2>
<h3 class="date">Tuesday (11/26/2019)</h3>
<p>The other "must-see" on my uncle's list was The Getty. It was just a couple miles down the 405 from my friend's home and she had been wanting to go. It wasn't really something to fully experience in a day, much less a few hours out of the morning, but I am still very happy to have visited and gotten a taste. The architecture, art, and views all gave me a sense that I was a smaller part of the bigger story.</p>

<h2>Pacific Surfliner</h2>
<h3 class="date" id="samedate">Still Tuesday (11/26/2019)</h3>
<p>This was my "alone" part of the trip, and as much as I try to avoid talking to the voices inside my head, it was probably a good thing that I had a few hours with them in such a special place. I sang <I>City of New Orleans</I> to myself as the train rolled out of Los Angeles and down to San Diego. At times the tracks passed so close to the beach that you felt you could reach out and touch the water. I picked the perfect time to ride and got to see the sun set along the coast.</p>

<h2>San Diego Zoo</h2>
<h3 class="date">Wednesday (11/27/2019)</h3>
<p>My uncle had picked me up at the train station Tuesday evening, and I had dinner and a game night with him and my aunt. On Wednesday morning, I went on a walk with my aunt. She is a retired postal worker who walked the streets of San Diego for years, always enjoying the beautiful weather and happy people in this Southern California wonderland. She didn't let retirement stop her, and walks about 3 miles every morning. After our walk we decided to check out the Zoo. She has a membership so I got in for free. We saw almost all the animals. I love the sections where different species share a habitat.</p>

<h2>Snow In The Desert</h2>
<h3 class = "date">Thursday (11/28/2019)</h3>
<p>Thanksgiving Day. Of course, when the midwesterner decides to take a trip Southern California, the <a href = "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-25/rain-snow-southern-california-thanksgiving">thunderstorms and snowstorms</a> roll in. But we made it safely to Morongo Valley, where my aunt and cousin live. We visited and reminisced, then went to dinner at <a href = "https://apps.thetropicale.com/m/thetropicalerestau/?appcode=thetropicalerestau">The Tropicale</a>, a mid-century themed restaurant in downtown Palm Springs. This was definitely the most unique Thanksgiving experience I had ever had, complete with a coconut martini! I got to meet an old friend of my uncle's who I had heard so much about growing up but never met in person. It was a special dinner and day. And by the way, the snow in the desert mountains really is beautiful.</p>

<h2>Mission Beach</h2>
<h3 class = "date">Friday (11/29/2019)</h3>
<p>On Friday morning we hugged and said goodbye to my Aunt who lives in the desert. We made the drive from the Desert back to the Ocean. I couldn't make a trip to San Diego without checking out one of the beautiful beaches. We walked up and down Mission Beach people watching, bird watching, and just enjoying the sea breeze.</p>

<h2>Studio</h2>
<h3 class="date" id="samedate">Still Friday (11/29/2019)</h3>
<p>While I had quality one-on-one time with my aunt during our walks and visit to the zoo, I also had the chance to spend time with my uncle who lives in the heart of San Diego, near the Hillcrest and University Heights neighborhoods. He has an historic home, beautiful guest cottage, and art studio/apartment where I stayed during my visit. I've become a lot closer to him in the last year and a half and have come to more deeply respect the life experiences he's had. He is an artist - by training and trade, he paints. But in practice he is also an artist with his words and the stories that he tells. When he relates an experience or an observation, he can articulate his thoughts and feelings and bring powerful emotions that might be just out of reach to the surface so that everyone around him can more fully appreciate the magnitude of the event. Whether he is telling a story from the past or is commenting on what is happening in the present, it is just more genuine when experienced with him. I'm glad I had the chance to talk with him about some of my anxieties, fears, and hopes for the future. He also has two cats that he inherited from my grandma when she passed. As much as love my dog Elena, my first pet was a cat and I will always be a cat person at heart. My husband's severe allergies keep us from having a feline at home, but I got to spend some quality time with my cat cousins.</p>

<h2>Tomorrow</h2>
<h3 class = "date">Saturday (11/30/2019)</h3>
<p>Even though it was the shortest day yet, I made the most of my last few hours in San Diego. I went with my Aunt on her morning walk, and had breakfast with her and my uncle at the delicious <a href = "https://www.josdinermissionhills.com/">Jo's Diner</a>. I may not have mentioned it earlier, but I am no stranger to the west coast. Some of the experiences on this trip were new - Huntington Gardens, The Getty, The Tropicale. But some were familiar - the drive through the desert, Mission Beach, and the San Diego Zoo. I grew up in Southern Illinois, but my dad grew up in Southern California. When we could afford it, our family vacations when I was a child were to visit his parents and siblings (my grandparents, uncle, and aunts) in the greater LA area, San Diego, and Palm Springs. My dad was my best friend and my biggest fan. The feeling was mutual. He died on August 1st, 2018 and it would be dishonest for me to say that I've processed his loss. I came out in Thanksgiving 2019 to visit my friends and my family, but I think I was also visiting my dad, and both of our childhood memories. I needed this week to connect to something that really had meaning and value in my life. I was reminded that I am allowed to enjoy myself, the love of family and friends, and the gifts of this world - both manmade and natural. I was reminded that I could be happy. It was good to revisit that feeling and it also inspired a new feeling within me - I had to do something new, something that would allow me to feel this way more often. I flew back to St. Louis on Saturday the 30th after a tearful goodbye and thank you at the San Diego airport. Within 2 weeks, I had applied for LaunchCode. Within 6 weeks, I had resigned from my job. Almost 4 months later, I wish I could say that I've worked through all my issues and am anxiety free. But, of course it is not so simple and change doesn't happen that quickly. I can say, though, that I am taking the baby steps to get to a better place. And I have Thanksgiving 2019 to Thank for that.</p>
